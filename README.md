# Http with Node

## Short Description

This is a sample audition project to show how to request HTTP resources using Node.

## Full Description

### Project Overview

You'll edit a basic JavaScript page, as well as fork a GitHub repository and clone it down locally.

### Applications and Tools You'll Need To Complete This Project

You'll need to have access to the following tools on your local machine to complete this project.

* Git
* GitHub
* Code Editor
* Command Line / Terminal Access

Never used Git and don’t have a code editor? We have a video that walks you through all the steps you’ll need to set this up.

### Prerequisite Knowledge

Completing all of the tasks in this project requires knowledge of basic JavaScript.  You'll also need to have a working knowledge of git to commit local changes and push them up to a GitHub repository.  We'll walk you through that part, so if you haven't used Git before -- don't worry. We recommend that you should have already completed the following Pluralsight Courses:

## Setting Up The Project

In order to get this working, you'll need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your computer, and have a GitHub account. If this is your first time setting up Git, I'd recommend checking out Pluralsight's video on How to Setup Git for Pluralsight Projects in 5 Minutes to learn what you need to know.

The very first step is to fork this repository to your personal GitHub account and clone it down locally. We'll be editing the `index.html` file in the root directory for this project.

### Associate Project with Pluralsight

After cloning this repository down, copy the ".projects_config" file from the [HelloPluralsightProject](#) and save that to this directory. This will allow your status to be reflected on the website while you're working through the project locally!

[//]: # (install: "npm install")
### Installation

Run the following command from root folder of the `HttpWithNode` project to install all dependencies.

```
$ npm install
```

[//]: # (test: "npm test")
[//]: # (test-watch: "npm test-watch")
### Verify Setup

In order to verify that everything is setup correctly, run the following command, which should show you a list of failing tests. This is good! Each of these tests corresponds to something we'll be working on in this project. By the end, all of the tests will pass.

```
$ npm test
```
